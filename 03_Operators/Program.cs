// ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

int additionResult = 5+2;
Console.WriteLine("5+2 =" +additionResult);

int subtractionResult = 5-2;
Console.WriteLine("5-2 = " +subtractionResult);

int multiplicationResult = 5 * 2;
Console.WriteLine("5 * 2 =" +multiplicationResult);

double divisionResult = 5 / 2d;
Console.WriteLine("5 / 2 =" +divisionResult);
/* IMPORTANT
The first time we rant the above looked like this:

int divisionResult = 5 / 2d;
Console.WriteLine("5 / 2 =" +divisionResult);

the output =2  

We changed the type to double and added a "d" to the 2 and when we ran it again, 
we got the correct answer of 2.5
